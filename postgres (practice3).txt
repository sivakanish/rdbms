CREATE INDEX emp_sub_id ON employees (subsidiary_id);
Although that gives decent performance, itâ€™s better to use the index that supports the primary key:

-- use tmp index to support the PK
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX employee_pk_tmp 
    ON employees (subsidiary_id, employee_id);

 ALTER TABLE employees 
   ADD CONSTRAINT employees_pk_tmp
UNIQUE (subsidiary_id, employee_id);

ALTER TABLE employees
 DROP CONSTRAINT employees_pk;

ALTER TABLE employees
  ADD CONSTRAINT employees_pk
      PRIMARY KEY (subsidiary_id, employee_id);

ALTER TABLE employees
 DROP CONSTRAINT employees_pk_tmp;

-- drop old indexes
DROP INDEX employee_pk_tmp;
DROP INDEX emp_sub_id;
